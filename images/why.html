            <p> To me dogs are beter then cats beacuse you can actually play with dogs and have a good time with them. With cats you cant do that since they like tomid therir own busniess a lot and scratch and hiss. I would take a little barking over scratching and hissing any day. If you want a cool and chill pet then cats are for you. But if you want a pet that will love you and keep you compay then dogs are for you.</p>
